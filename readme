- Aim of the project 
	user objectify as a persistance API at the spring boot project. First we use a with a Data Store Emulator 
	than deploy it to a Cloud Run service as a real cloud project.  

- What is Objectify?

- What is Data store emulator?
	- install datastore emulator
			> gcloud components install cloud-datastore-emulator

- What I use in the project? 
	- Lombok
	- JUnit5
	- Objectify
		 compile('com.googlecode.objectify:objectify:6.0.4')

- ObjectifyService
	-The default init() will connect to the default DatastoreService configured for your environment. But if you will use emulator, you have 	to initialize yourself 
	- If we are using emulator, we have to call ObjectifyService.init() before registery or using any of objectify(including ofy()).
		 	Otherwise we get exception: Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: You must call ObjectifyService.init() before using Objectify
	- define datastore emulator as datastore
		- start data store emulator
			> gcloud beta emulators datastore start --host-port=localhost:8484

- Writing persistance layer
	- what is ObjectifyRegistery? why we need to a registration
		
	- Using ofy() as persister
	
	- ObjectifyFilter
		- .Unless you will get java.lang.IllegalStateException: You have not started an Objectify context.
			You are probably missing the ObjectifyFilter. If you are not running in the context of an http request, see the ObjectifyService.run() method.
		- Objectify requires a filter for transactions and pending requests.
		- we use webfilter with @WebFilter annotation, and execute it in runtime.
